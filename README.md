# LaTeX Guidelines

Remember that whenever you see something like 

![Overleaf Error](/OverError.png)


It means that you did a mistake. You have to fix it before the submission. Click on it to have additional information!
For example, clicking on this specific error we get 

![Overleaf Error 1](/WrongNewline.png)


It is very useful to know that:
 * The problem was a misplaced newline.
 * The problem is at line 127

Sometimes you could see a pdf even if there are errors. This does not mean that everything is fine!!!

## Equations

### Basic knowledge

There are several **not equivalent** ways to write an equation in LaTeX:

 * *inline equations*. Is when you place a single dollar signs at both ends, i.e. `$ equation_code $`
 * *not numbered equations* (which I discourage). Can be obtained in one of the following:
    *  Double dollar sign, i.e.  `$$ equation_code $$`

### Numbering



# Newlines
