## LaTeX Guidelines

Remember that whenever you see something like 

![Overleaf Error](/OverError.png)


It means that you did a mistake. You have to fix it before the submission. Click on it to have additional information!
For example, clicking on this specific error we get 

![Overleaf Error 1](/WrongNewline.png)


It is very useful to know that:
 * The problem was a misplaced newline.
 * The problem is at line 127

Sometimes you could see a pdf even if there are errors. This does not mean that everything is fine!!!
